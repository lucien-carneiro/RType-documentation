Welcome to our R-Type documentation!
====================================

**R-Type** is the final project made in our second year in Epitech.
The goal of this project is to create a network game.
Several teams confront on a tiles map containing resources.

Thus there is three parts to this project:

- **The server:** Resource service software that responds to UPD requests
- **The client:** Software designed to connect to a server via sockets
- **The Entity Component System:** Software architectural pattern who represent the game world object
